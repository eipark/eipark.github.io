      <a href="http://www.effectivetaxcalculator.com/">Effective Tax Calculator</a>: a simple tool to help you calculate your effective tax. Tech: React, Netlify, Webpack

      <a href="http://github.com/epark/xboard">xBoard</a>: Recordable HTML5 Canvas based Recordable Whiteboard. xBoard is unpolished and never got past an academic project, but I think it's a cool concept. It uses basic web technologies to create a video-like recordable experience around a whiteboard, complete with standard 'video' controls like play, pause, and scrubbing. All in the browser. Tech: JS, HTML5 Canvas
