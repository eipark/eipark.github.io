  Hi, I'm Ernie Park. I am a <span style="color:#999;">(full-stack but trying to specialize on front-end)</span> software engineer working at <a href="http://dev.hubspot.com">HubSpot</a>. This is my personal website and blog where I'll try to write about some of the things that interest me most, including: software development, Christian life, sports, and personal finance.
  </p>
  <p>
In my work life, I love building helpful, usable web applications. After graduating from <a href="http://web.mit.edu">MIT</a>, I founded a startup called MicroEval with funding from <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> but ended up leaving that venture for personal reasons (blog post on that to come). I've also worked at <a href="http://ooyala.com">Ooyala</a> and <a href="http://vecna.com">Vecna</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
Besides dev, I love to play sports (ice hockey, lacrosse, golf) and sing. I live in Cambridge, MA with my wife and dog.
