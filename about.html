  Hi, I'm Ernie Park. I am a <span style="color:#999;">(full-stack but focused on front-end)</span> software engineer working at <a href="http://dev.hubspot.com">HubSpot</a>. I'm trying to write more about things that interest me like software development, Christian life, sports, and personal finance. All posts reflect solely my own personal opinions.
  </p>
  <p>
In my work life, I love building helpful, usable web applications. After graduating from MIT, I founded a startup called MicroEval with funding from <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a> which was a great experience.
  </p>
  <p>
Besides dev, I love to play sports (ice hockey, lacrosse, golf) and sing. I live in Cambridge, MA with my wife and dog.
