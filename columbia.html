      <h2>321 Columbia Street #1, 2bed/1ba Furnished</h2>
      <h4>Available 9/1 for 1 year lease. NO FEE</h4>
      <p>
        This is a 1st floor apartment in a 3 story building. The apartment comes preferably furnished. Both bedrooms are a good size with two levels of closet hanging space. The square footage is small, but the space is used extremely efficiently. The apt is set back from the main road for a nice quiet space. Neighbors, location, and landlord are great :). It's a 5 min walk to Inman, <10 mins to Central, and <15 mins to Kendall Square. Close to several bus lines as well.<br /><br />
        Pets negotiable. Our dogs not included.
