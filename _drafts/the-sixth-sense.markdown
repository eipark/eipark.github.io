Software development has been around for a long time, but there's no doubt that the 'trendiness' and 'pop-culture' of startups and devs revolves mostly around younger
people right now. Less emphasis is placed on experience.

Sixth sense is when you know that something doesn't sit right, developing that intuition to say confidently: I can write this in a shitty way, or this will hurt us down the line.

It's the differnece between an engineer saying "that sounds like a great idea", to "well how does that impact x/y/z"

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
