# Personal Finance Basics for New Graduates


Like many other recent graduates into the workforce, I didn't know much about personal finance, taxes, 401k's, deductions, exemptions, and all these other big words adults seemed to use all the time. A good understanding of personal finance is crucial. )While most of this information is readily available in books, the internet, or your Uncle Bob, it is generally acquired piecemeal and over months and years (or sometimes never at all). My hope with this post is to highlight many of the basics of personal finance and earning a paycheck that I learned over my first few years out of college in a digestable way.

This post will progressively build upon the concepts and terms learned to give you a somewhat full picture of what your finances may look like.

## Tax Basics

* Basic Terms
* Deductions
* Exemptions
* Tax Returns

Getting your first paycheck is a fantastic feeling... until you see how much you lose to taxes. For better or for worse, "the only thing certain in life is death and taxes". The US Tax Code can often be an enigma with many rules and dimensions, but is not too complicated once you break it down.

Let's establish a few basic terms to start:

* __gross income__: the money you earn before any taxes are levied, equal to your salary or hourly wage * hours worked in a year
* __taxable income__: the amount of money you earn that can be taxed 
* __net income__: the money you earn after taxes are taken away (as well as other pre-tax deductions which we will learn about later)
* __filing status__: (single, married separately, married jointly, head of household). This determines how you file your taxes and alters certain amounts, thresholds, tax rates, etc. See more here: (here)[]

At a high level, there are two types of taxes: federal and state. The amount of state taxes vary by state - check your state tax law for exact information. In Massachusetts where I live, state taxes are ..... Federal taxes are taxed at what is called a marginal rate. Depending on your income, you fall into a tax bracket which determines your tax rate. For 2014 the tax table is:

Every paycheck you receive is extrapolated over a full year to determine what your yearly income might be.

__Example 1__

```
Henrik lives in NY state and his salary (gross income) is $100,000 a year. For now, assume his taxable income is also $100,000 a year. He is in the 28% tax bracket. This does not mean his federal taxes are .28x$100,000, but instead it is .15 on the first $73, ..... This second taable makes it easier to calculate marginal tax bracket so we only need to know the amount made over the previous tax bracket. For state income taxes, ...After deducting both state and federal taxes, his net income is $xxx.
```

##### Tax Deductions

__deduction__: something that reduces your taxable income
 
In the previous Example #1, we assumed gross income was equivalent to taxable income meaning that you are taxed on all the money you earn. Fortunately, this is usually not the case. Federal taxes are levied against your *taxable* income rather than your *gross* income. So what can reduce your taxable income and make it less than your gross income? __Deductions__! 

Deductions are great since they reduce your taxable income and therefore lower your overall tax bill. They are essentially the government's way of saying, you should not have to pay taxes on money that will be spent towards certain things (such as charitable donations, certain medical costs, education, etc.)

So how do deductions work? There are two ways that deductions can be calculated - either using the 1. __standard deduction__, or 2. __itemized deduction__. You calculate the value of both deduction types, but only use the method that results in a higher deduction for you.

Every employee who (TODO: ) makes over $xxx qualifies for the standard deduction. Here are the amounts of the standard deduction: TODO xxx

Every worker in the US receives the standard deduction which for single filers like Henrik, is $$$$. So lets adjust our previous tax calculation from example 1 to account for the standard deduction and see how that changes our tax picture.

__Example 2__

```
Henrik makes $100k gross salary a year, but with the standard deduction of $xxxx, his taxable income is $xxxx. His tax bracket is based on his *taxable* income so it is xxx%. 

Now we calculate the total taxes like we did in Example 1.
.15 * xxx
.20 * xxx
.28 * xxx

The standard deduction saved Henrik $xxx.

```

Most workers use the standard deduction. Itemized deductions are slightly more complicated. You've probably heard the term 'tax-deductible' thrown around a lot, especially in regards to charities. "All your donations are tax-deductible". All this means is that the value of your donation can reduce your taxable income by that same amount. However, the catch is that the sum all your deductions must be greater than the standard deduction for you to use an itemized deduction. So if I donated $100 to the Red Cross in 2013, it won't make a difference in my taxes because I already receive the standard deduction worth $xxx. At tax return time, I don't have to report this donation. However, if I donated $10000 tax-deductible dollars to various non-profits and charities, I could receive a deduction of $10000 versus the standard deduction, and I would have to report all these deductions.

Donating to qualified non-profits is not the only way to get tax-deductions. There are many different ways you can reduce your taxable income. For instance: 

* mortgage interest
* certain medical expenses
* pre-tax investments (like 401k, which we'll learn about later)
* health/dental insurance costs taken out of your paycheck pretax
* blah

More information on tax deductions is available here: _____. 

Let's see another example with an itemized deduction instead.

__Example 3__

```
Henrik made $100k gross. He donated $5000 to the Red Cross, $1000 worth of goods to Goodwill, got this deduction and that. The sum of these tax deductions is $xxx. Since $xxx > the standard deduction of $xxx, Henrik files his taxes with the itemized deduction rather than the standard deduction. He reports to the IRS all these deductions when he files his tax return and thus, his taxable income is only $xxx.
```

##### Filing taxes

To this point we've learned how to calculate how much in taxes are pulled from your paycheck, as well as how deductions can alter your taxable income. What we've glossed over though is how your taxes actually get adjusted by deductions. Your employer doesn't know about your tax-deductions and cannot adjust your taxes every paycheck. 

This is where __filing taxes__ comes in. The dreaded tax season you've heard of is when you tell the IRS about your deductions as well as any income you've earned over the last calendar year (among many other things). Your tax filings are due by April 15 for the previous years taxes (e.g. April 15, 2015 for taxes in 2014). If you haven't been taxed enough through the year, you owe the IRS money and have to send them a check. If you've been overtaxed (which is commonly the case once you factor in your deductions), you get a __tax return__ and the IRS sends you a nice fat check!

Taxes can be filed manually on paper, electronically through different services, or through tax professionals. I recommend using Intuit's TurboTax. Taxes can be very confusing, and TurboTax generally does a good job of walking you through all the different scenarios and making sure you report everything you need to. 

If you are a worker on a payroll, expect to get a __W2 Form__  (xxx link or image) early in the year (January) from each employer. The W2 describes how much money you earned and how much you were taxed. You will use the figures on the W2 to calculate what your total taxes should be. The W2 is the most standard form that reports your income, however, there are many other forms you may receive depending on how you earn money (investments, lottery, prizes, sell property etc). You also are required to report cash income (say tips), though this does not always happen. 

We will not go too deep into tax returns here, but understand that they are the method by which taxes are adjusted up or down at the end of the year. Make sure to be honest and report all your income and deductions or else you may be audited by the IRS which basically means they believe there's a discrepancy in how much they think you should be taxed and what you reported. This process can be costly and time consuming (as I've experienced). The best way to avoid this is by keeping very good records of all money you earn and spend. 

##### Exemptions & The W4 Form

__Exemption__: A number between 1-20 that is used to alter your taxable income via a formula?

Although filing your taxes adjusts your taxes at the end of a year, you can actually adjust how much you are taxed throughout the year via a __W4 Form__ (xxx link and image). You file a W4 Form whenever you start working for a new employer. You are free to fill out the W4 Form however you want in a way that adjusts your taxes up or down on each paycheck. However, you will ultimately end up paying the same amount over time when you file taxes.

The W4 Form consists primarily of two numbers: 1. Exemptions, 2. Deductions. 

If you feel you might need more money from each paycheck, you can choose to lower your tax burden using higher number of exemptions. But be careful as you will likely have to pay the IRS come tax filing time. 

Ideally though, you should filly out the W4 to reflect your situation as closely as possible so you can get the most amount of money in each paycheck, without having to owe the IRS any money when you file your taxes. Getting a big tax return is nice, but it means you got less every paycheck and essentially gave the IRS a free loan.



## Retirement Accounts

If you're lucky, your employer offers a 401k plan which will help you save money for retirement. Even if you are not offered an employer-sponsored 401k plan, there are still many ways you can save for retirement. Though the topic of retirement and investing can often be very intimidating, for 99% of people, getting a workable grasp of all the concepts is fairly easy.

First, understand that you have many different __investment vehicles__ (better term), or more simply, places you can put your money. The simplest, is of course, cash. Then, you have checking accounts, and maybe even a savings account that earns you some small amount of interest. You're probably aware of these types of vehicles. Others that get a bit more complicated include stocks (owning a share of a company like Apple or Exxon), mutual funds (a group of stocks that someone manages), bonds (loans you are giving to the government). Generally, the higher the risk of your investment, the higher potential returns. Your savings account is likely to yield paltry interest of less than 1%, but you are essentially guaranteed to get that interest. Stocks on the other hand, could return you 25% on your money in a year, but at the same time, can crash and lose 50% of its value (like in the recession in 2008). Generally, the longer you can invest your money, the more risk you can afford. If you are young like me, you can put your money into stocks or similar proxies for stocks like mutual funds and index funds.

Now that we've covered some basic __investment vehicles__ we can move on to __account types__ (xxx). While investment vehicles are where your money is actually stored or invested, account types detail how the IRS taxes and treats the money you earn or lose through these investments. 401ks, IRAs, and standard-taxable investment accounts are all types of accounts. __The account type does not dictate the type of investment vehicles within it. It only covers how it is taxed and treated by the IRS.__ 401ks and IRAs are types of __Retirement Accounts__. Retirement accounts are generally given special tax treatment by the IRS to encourage people to save.

#### 401k

Employer-sponsored 401ks are the most common type of retirement account. You tell your employer a certain percentage of your gross income you'd like to put into your 401k account. Every paycheck, that money is put into your 401k and your paycheck is reduced. 401ks are special though, in that they reduce your taxable income. They are a deduction just like any other we discussed in the previous section. However, one additional benefit is that deductions from the 401k can be added on top of your 401k. This means you can save money in a 401k for retirement while also reducing your tax burden.
Let's see what this might look like in real life.

__Example__

```
Henrik makes $120k/yr and gets $5k gross per paycheck (paid twice a month). He gets an employee sponsored 401k plan that he contributes 10% of his gross income to. At the end of the year, he has contributed $12,000 to his 401k. He has received no itemized deductions and takes the standard deduction. His taxable income is $120k - $12000 - $standard deduction (xxx). ==> $xxx, and he also has $12000 in his 401k +/- any gains or losses incurred.
```

You may be asking at this point though, where does the money in a 401k actually go? A 401k is just an account type, but we've said nothing about the types of investment vehicles that are actually in a 401k. Generally, 401ks are provided through companies such as Fidelity or Chase. These companies allow you to set up a 401k account within which you can put your money into different investment vehicles. For instance, your 401k money can be put into stocks, mutual funds, or even target retirement funds (xxx link). It is up to you to decide how your money is actually allocated within the 401k. I will not go into the nitty gritty on how to allocate your 401k here. Personally though, I use a target retirement fund as it is dead simple and requires essentially no management on your part after set up. 

Match: Some employers even offer a 401k match, meaning, they'll match a certain amount of money you contribute to your 401k. This is free money your employer is giving you. make sure to take advantage of it to the fullest.

You don't touch money til you're 65 or other withdrawal stuff. Penalties.

more on 401k here...

#### IRA

401ks are one type of retirement account. There are also IRAs. IRAs can be contributed to via post-tax dollars. You can create an IRA yourself through companies like Fidelity or Chase, but I highly recommend Vanguard. 

#### Roth IRA

The Roth IRA is a special type of IRA in that your earnings grow tax free. In other accounts, once you're ready to actually withdraw your money (so selling the stocks or funds within your account), you have to pay some level of tax. Any money you earn in a Roth IRA is tax-free as you've already contributed. 

#### Standard investment accounts

Generally, you want to max out your retirement accounts as much as possible. Since they are tax-advantaged, it makes sense to take advantage of them first. However, if you're fortunate enough that you've exhausted most of your tax-advantaged options (Roth IRA, 401k, etc), you should start thinking of investing in taxed accounts. Like my other accounts, my taxable investment accounts are also with Vanguard due to their low fees. Any money you make through standard investment accounts is treated as __capital gain__. Capital gain is money you make with money, or capital. This is taxed differently than normal income. Any investments you hold for less than a year (buy some stock in March, sell in May of same year) is taxed under short term capital gains, and any held for longer than a year are taxed at the long term capital gains rate. The chart for 2014 is listed below.


__Example__

```
Henrik opens an investment account on Vanguard.com. In that account, he buys $1000 of VXXXX, a mutual fund, on February 2014. In August 2014, the value of the account has risen to $1100. Henrik realizes he needs money for an emergency and decides to sell the fund, so he receives $1100 back. He has gained a net $100. Because he held fund for only 6 months, less than a year, he is taxed at the short term capital gains rate of x% on the $100 he earned, so $xxx total.

Let's say Henrik didn't sell the fund in August 2014, and instead sold it in March of 2020. Now his initial $1000 investment has increased to $1800. Since he has held onto the fund for longer than a year, he receives the lower, long-term capital gains rate of 15%. Thus, he is taxed 15% on $800 profit, or $120. His $1000 investment has earned him a net of $680 in a few years. 
```

Keep in mind cpital gains taxes are adjusted at tax filing time. They do NOT adjust the amount of money you receive when you sell the stock. So in the previous example, Henrik would get the full $1800 when he sold his funds, but his tax bill would be $120 higher at filing time. 

## Advice

I'd like to switch gears now and give my own two cents on this whole personal finance business.

#### Save now!
 
You've probably heard it a million times. Compounding interest is your friend. Time is your friend. But seriously, it's your friend. Graph/tool. 5, 10, 50 years from now, don't be the one saying "I wish I could go back in time and tell 21 year old me to stop wasting money and start saving!".

#### Order of operations

1. Emergency Fund (likely in a savings account)
2. 401k Match/Debts
3. Retirement Accounts
4. Investment Accounts


#### Emergency Fund or Rainy-Day Fund

In general, it's good practice to build up a bit of an emergency fund before you start putting money anywhere else (with the exception of maybe a 401k that offers an employer match). An emergency fund is generally a few months worth of expenses to hold you over in the case of an emergency (medical expenses, lose your job, etc.).

#### Build Credit, Get rewards

Get credit card if you are disciplined enough. Get rewards, build credit. Use for house purchase in future if you need. My favorite card by far is the Chase Sapphire Preferred which offers a huge signup bonus, and great bonuses for travel. I also use the Chase Freedom for its 5% rotating categories.

#### Track expenses/Budget
I like to budget using YNAB. I keep track of expenses meticulously. Not everyone likes to do this. Find what works for you. At the very least, know how much money you're making and spending each month.

#### Increase your earning potential

Especially when you're young and early in your career, the best investment you can usually make is in yourself. Developing your skills and abilities now will compound your earning potential for the rest of your career.
