Like many other recent graduates into the workforce, I didn't know much about personal finance, taxes, 401k's, etc. Without a good understanding of personal finance, it's difficult to maintain good control of your finances and maximize your earnings. While most of this information is readily available, it is generally acquired piecemeal and over months and years. My hope with this series of posts is to highlight many of the basics of personal finance that I learned over my first two years out of college in a digestable way.

Getting your first paycheck is a fantastic feeling... until you see how much you lose to taxes. For better or for worse, "the only thing certain in life is death and taxes". The US Tax Code can often be an enigma with many rules and dimensions, but is not too complicated once you break it down.

Terms
gross income: the money you earn before any taxes are levied, equal to your salary or hourly wage
taxable income: the amount of money you earn that can be taxed
net income: the money you earn after taxes are taken away (as well as other pre-tax deductions which we will learn about later)

At a high level, there are two types of taxes: federal and state. The amount of state taxes vary by state - check your state tax law for exact information. In Massachusetts where I live, state taxes are ..... Federal taxes are taxed at what is called a marginal rate. Depending on your income, you fall into a tax bracket which determines your tax rate. For 2014 the tax table is:

Every paycheck you receive is extrapolated over a full year to determine what your yearly income might be.

Example: Henrik lives in Massachusetts and his salary (gross income) is $100,000 a year. For now, assume his taxable income is also $100,000 a year. He is in the 28% tax bracket. This does not mean his federal taxes are .28x$100,000, but instead it is .15 on the first $73, ..... This second taable makes it easier to calculate marginal tax bracket so we only need to know the amount made over the previous tax bracket. For state income taxes, ...After deducting both state and federal taxes, his net income is $foo.

Deductions
deduction: something that reduces your taxable income
Since deductions reduce your taxable income
In the previous example #1, we assumed gross income was equivalent to taxable income, however this is usually not the case. Federal taxes are levied against the taxable income rather than the gross income. So what can change your taxable income and make it different than gross income? Deductions! Deductions are great since they reduce your taxable income and therefore lower your overall tax bill. They are essentially the government's way of saying, you should not have to pay taxes on money that will be spent towards certain things (such as charitable donations, certain medical costs, education, etc.)

There are two ways that deductions can be accounted for - either via the standard deduction, or itemized deduction. Every worker in the US receives the standard deduction which for single filers like Henrik, is $$$$. So lets adjust our previous tax calculation from example 1 to account for the standard deduction.

Example 2: Henrik makes $100k gross salary a year, but with the standard deduction of $xxxx, his taxable income is $xxxx. His tax bracket is based on his taxable income so it is $.....
Your tax rate is determined by your taxable income.

Exemptions - the W2 form
Whenever you begin employment with a new employer, you must fill out a W2 form which details how many exemptions and deductions you want to claim. You can fill out whatever you want on this form, to either maximize or minimize your take-home net income per paycheck, however it must be adjusted come tax return time. In general, you want to make sure enough taxes are taken so that you do not owe the government any money come tax filing time.

Tax returns
Because tax calculations are not perfect (say if your income changes) and deductions adjust your tax rate, tax returns can be filed by April 15 of the following year. Depending on whether you were overtaxed or undertaxed, you will pay more taxes or receive a return. Note that you must file tax returns separately for each state you received income from as well as the federal tax return.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
