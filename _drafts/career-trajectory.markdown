 cant know full career trajectory ahead of time
 plan ahead, have interest,s but optimize for learning, and growing
 salary important, but think also long-term... doing what you enjoy/are good at will probably pay bigger dividends down the line than a $5k-$10k bump now
 other opportunities will line up
 opportunities within company matter a ton, growing company? more opp to shine
 plan, but be flexible and open.
 learn from every situation.
